# Bitcoin-miner-script
more money



***CONFIG***
So for the Configuration, change "address="YOUR BTC ADDRESS GOES HERE" ", with your actual btc address.

I would recommend running this code in a 4-Core, 32GB, Codespace. As it will function just like a machine but cause no damage.
If you don't know how to execute the code its simple, open your CMD, Terminal, Shell, or what ever you can execute code on. Just copy and paste BTCMINER.sh code and paste it in your terminal, same with code space.




I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE DONE TO YOUR OR OTHERS MACHINE! In other words, It is important to note that attempting to mine Bitcoin using a personal computer is not profitable and could potentially damage your hardware. Additionally, this script could potentially be harmful to your system, and it is important to be cautious when running any script obtained from an external source.
